    "Upon entering the raid, before starting the first encounter, the fireteam should divert to the secret area known as the Wall of Wishes.\n\nHere various secret codes can be entered by shooting the twenty circular plates to change the symbol they display.  The available ‘wishes’ can be seen in the image below, simply recreate the pattern shown and then step inside the glowing blue ring to active the wall.  Note: stepping into the blue ring early will fail the wish and reset all of the wall’s symbols to blank.\n\n*Note:* Players new to the raid should enter Wish 1 to receive a free Ethereal Key; this can only be done once per account."
