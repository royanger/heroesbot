    "After completing the Waking Ruins, begin traversing The Trial of Kabr, stopping in a room with a seemingly endless chasm emitting yellow-green light.  Jump down to a ledge on the left and turn back toward the previous ledge.  A hidden entrance will be designated by hanging vines in a crevasse.  Jump inside and follow the path to find a room with a Vex plate.  The chest can be found in the right side of the room."
