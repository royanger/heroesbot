    "Mechanics: Confluxes, Marked for Negation, Overload Champions\n\nOverview:\n\n• Prevent Vex from sacrificing at the Confluxes.After traveling deeper into the Vault of Glass, the fireteam will enter the Templar’s Well where the next three encounters take place.  Upon dropping down into the arena, a Vex structure can be seen.  This is known as a Conflux, and this encounter requires defending three Confluxes which will spawn around the map; one to the left, one to the right, and one near the middle.  First defending one Conflux, then two, and finally all three at once from waves of Vex.  The Vex will march towards a Conflux before kneeling down and sacrificing themselves.  If four lesser Vex, a single Wyvern, or a single Overload Champion completes their sacrifice, the fireteam will wipe.\n\nAnother notable enemy you'll face during this encounter is the Fanatic, a headless Goblin that explodes on death. These enemies drop pools of energy when slain.  These pools do more than just damage you, when entered you will gain the \"Marked for Negation\" debuff. If you do not remove this debuff before the Templar commences its next Ritual of Negation, you will be instantly killed.  To cleanse this debuff, you must walk over the Vex Sync Plate at the very center of the arena. A text prompt stating \"CLEANSED\" will appear to the left of your crosshair, indicating that you've removed the debuff. This plate has a cooldown before it can be used again, so be sure that every player who's Marked for Negation walks into the pool simultaneously to cleanse their debuff"
