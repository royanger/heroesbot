    "**Mechanics**: Gorgons\n\n**Overview**:\n• Navigate the maze.\n• Make it to the Throne Room Gate\n\nAfter a short walk, and a long fall, the fireteam will enter the Gorgon's Labyrinth.  This area is patrolled by Gorgons, glowing Harpies that will alert and then, after a few seconds, wipe the fireteam if they spot anyone. Unlike the rest of the raid, this encounter is a stealth section.  There are multiple routes through the maze, but the most consistent option tends to be using the large rocks on the left-hand side of the main maze area to jump over the Gorgons.  The exit can be found beside a large rock jutting out of the ground at a steep angle. Jump off the rock and run towards the lit cave to find the escape tunnel.\n\nThere are three floating Vex cubes in the Gorgon’s Labyrinth all three need to be destroyed without wiping to open a large door containing a secret chest and Rally Banner point.  This door is on the right side of the maze from the spawn point."
