# Helpless Heroes Discord Bot

This is a bot designed for the Helpless Heroes clan discord. The initial (and possibly only) core feature will be an LFG tool.

## Running the Bot

You will need to create a `config.json` file and include details from the `config.sample.json` file.

In development, use the following command to run the bot.

`npm run dev`

When doing so you should see `Client ready to log into discord` appear in your console and the bot should log on inside Discord.
